# Airbnb prediction case

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

In this business case, you are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.

There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. Please note that 'NDF' is different from 'other' because 'other' means there was a booking, but is to a country not included in the list, while 'NDF' means there wasn't a booking.

# Solution Strategy

The method applied was CRISP-DM:

**Step 01. Data Description:** The objective is to use statistical metrics to identify outliers in the business scope.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering:** Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon to be modeled.

**Step 03. Data Filtering:** Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or do not correspond to the business scope.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

**Step 05. Data Preparation:** Prepare data so machine learning models can learn specific behavior.

**Step 06. Selection of resources:** Selection of the most significant attributes to train the model.

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modeling:** machine learning model training

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning:** Choose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected in the previous step.

**Step 09. Convert model performance to business values:** Convert model performance to a business result.

**Step 10. Deploy Model to Production:** Publish the model to a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.
