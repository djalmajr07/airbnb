# Solution Strategy

The method applied was CRISP-DM:

**Step 01. Data Description:** The objective is to use statistical metrics to identify outliers in the business scope.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering:** Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon to be modeled.

**Step 03. Data Filtering:** Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or do not correspond to the business scope.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

**Step 05. Data Preparation:** Prepare data so machine learning models can learn specific behavior.

**Step 06. Selection of resources:** Selection of the most significant attributes to train the model.

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modeling:** machine learning model training

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning:** Choose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected in the previous step.

**Step 09. Convert model performance to business values:** Convert model performance to a business result.

**Step 10. Deploy Model to Production:** Publish the model to a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.

**Step 11. Telegram Bot:** Creation of a bot on the telegram app, to consult the forecast at any time
